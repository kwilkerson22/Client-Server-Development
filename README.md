# Client-Server-Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In Project One, I developed a CRUD module that kept the database implementation separate from the dashboard implementation. By doing this, I established clear responsibilities for each part of the application. This modular design allows the CRUD module to be connected to other applications without neededing to rewrite the core logic. I followed best practices by being consistent with naming conventions and including inline comments to ensure my code was readable and easy to maintain. The project was adaptable becauce it could handle a wide range of queries. In the future, I would consider using this CRUD module to manage inventory for an online store.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
